Try the latest version of W&B for machine learning experiment tracking. We've moved the new release into our [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/wandb/client). Install the new library with:

```
pip install wandb --upgrade --pre
```

Why should I switch to the new CLI?
- Better support for Windows and Jupyter notebooks
- Preview the upcoming release and share feedback
